I have been building reading apps for 3 years now. The first full-stack app I ever built was [socialbook.io](https://socialbook-io-react-app.vercel.app/signin), which allowed you to create a public digital library and share it with others. I envisioned a future where discourse around books was more open and available. 

Since then I've gone on to build 8 more versions. I tried building a book summary app ([here](https://github.com/invicta-app)), a 3D reading experience (this failed), and even built a TikTok interface for readers with attention difficulties ([here](https://rewrite-v2.vercel.app/)). All of these were preliminary experiments in an attempt to complete my life's work, which up until recently was something vaguely about *books.*

This past week I approach my life's work with a newfound clarity. The mission is clear, the idea is sound, and the gears are starting to turn. I can feel a profound sense of clarity. I'm excited.

Outlined below is the brand strategy for the Openbook mission. I'd love to hear feedback and see if there's anything that should be clarified. For those supporting me, I appreciate everything you do. A special thank you to my Mum, Cindy, & Karsen.

Onwards and upwards,
Marcelo Mantilla
