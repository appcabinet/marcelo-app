You can accurately judge the quality of ones philosophy by the outcomes it creates in that person's life. Negative belief systems will naturally draw that person towards chaos, whilst positive ones will tend to bring order and peace.

Questions such as:
- Are they kind?
- How emotionally charged are they?
- Do they have any outward resentments?
- Do they care for others?
- etc.

Fundamentally, these are the most important elements of one philosophy/political outlook in life. Regardless of what one may believe, we should still desire that the person is kind, regarding of others, and does not litter in the street.

Therefore, when someone takes to telling you about their political inclinations or philosophical ideas, observe *how they are.* This will tell you more about what they really believe, or if their current belief system is serving them well.

"Thus you will know them by their fruits."
Matthew 7:15-20, ESV
