Latest developments in AI computing reflect a massive technological shift towards cheap and accessible intelligence. Developers like myself are able to access various language model API's and begin leveraging intelligence in all my applications.

As developers, we are prone to tool-building and tool-using behaviours. The natural instinct when presented with a new technological innovation is ultimately: *what can I do with it?* Such was undoubtedly the case with ChatGPT. Months after its release, AI tools flooded the market as investors rushed to capitalize on the innovation.

The instinct to build tools around the technological advancement of lager language models leads to a glaring oversight by developers, but ultimately by the general public as well. **AI models fed with the worlds data have the ability to raise the collective consciousness of the world.** Fed with sufficient data, LLMs are capable of successfully abstracting general language patterns and human behaviours; this implies that the LLMs are *successfully forming simulated representations of the world.*

This was Elon Musk's aim with [xAI](https://x.ai/) â€“ to create an unbiased and truthful and large language model that can be used to explore fundamental human truths and beyond.

At a moments notice, you have access to an entity that has more knowledge density than anyone you could ever hope to meet. Although this tool can be easily appropriated to build amazing tools, there is a simple, forgotten use case that many of long-since left behind.

*Conversing.*

Although this claim sounds quite rudimentary, I invite you to think about it further. If I asked you 5 years ago if you could talk to a hyper-intelligent AI that contained within it a large percentage of the worlds knowledge and patterns, would you deny the opportunity to speak with it?
In that scenario 5 years ago, what would you have asked it? What ideas would you want to bounce off it? What would you want to know? I find it highly unlikely 

you asked it everything you could have ever wanted when ChatGPT first came out. Furthermore, I imagine that asking it to return JSON would not be high on the list of things you'd like it to do.

Although building AI tooling that is valuable and innovative is a great thing to do, it is strangely easy to become accustomed to the idea of a super-intelligent being right in your pocket. Every now and then, I invite you to converse with the large language model of your choice. Use it to penetrate your understanding of the world, and deepen your knowledge. This is perhaps, what you would have done 5 years ago.
