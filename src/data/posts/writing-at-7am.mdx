I've recently been waking up around 6:30AM in a deliberate attempt to re-align my circadian rhythm. Still feeling groggy, I'll quickly pack my computer bag and head to the closest Starbucks, which conveniently opens up at 5:30AM. Along the 20 minute passage I'll pass-by early commuters, chirping birds, and an oft open sky, inviting me to the day ahead.

Since I have gone every day for the past week, the employees are quick to greet me and provide me with my Starbucks beverage of choice (omitting here to avoid criticism :P). As I sit down and get in front my computer, I am in a completely different state then when I am at 9:30AM, ready to begin my workday.

Arriving to the coffee shop with no plan whatsoever, I find myself drawn to a natural and effortless flow of exploration. This has been one of the most rewarding parts of my mornings. I'll hop into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and begin thinking out loud. I'll think of an idea, write it down, link it, and move on. I'll read parts of a current book I'm reading, take notes, and sip from my beverage. Without any intention of getting anything done, I am in a space to piece together remote ideas and cultivate a deeper understanding of myself and the world.

Needless to say, this has been deeply rewarding. It is quite easy to find myself with the pressure of having to make progress, *to build something the world can see*. However, in these quiet mornings, with nothing but my computer and my mind, I've found myself a little closer to home.
